## 📍 Key Insights

### 🔹 Agricultural Value Added (USD)

* **Insight**: Constant growth since 2001
* **Peak**: \$2.1 billion USD in 2020

### 🔹 Annual Growth Rate (%)

* **Insight**: Fluctuating growth
* **Highest**: 14.3% in 2008

### 🔹 Share of Economy (%)

* **Insight**: Agriculture consistently contributed \~30% of GDP

## 📌 Conclusion

* **Steady Growth**: From \$850M (2001) to \$2.1B (2020)
* **Peak Performance**: Despite global crises (e.g., COVID-19)
* **Volatility**: Sharp rises (e.g., 2008, 2012, 2016) and drops (e.g., 2005, 2013)
* **Economic Contribution**: Stable 28–32% of GDP
* **Forecast**: Predicted to exceed \$2.5B by 2025

## 🧭 Recommendations

1. **Enhance Data Granularity**
   → Collect monthly/district-level agricultural data

2. **Integrate Environmental Factors**
   → Rainfall, soil data, fertilizer use, etc.

3. **Improve Data Governance**
   → Standardized collection/reporting methods

4. **Institutionalize Predictive Tools**
   → Embed forecasting (Power BI/Python) in policy planning

5. **Foster Stakeholder Collaboration**
   → Link MINAGRI, cooperatives, and data institutions

## 🔮 Predictive Value of the Project

* Supports long-term **agriculture planning**
* Forecasts trends up to **2025 and beyond**
* Identifies critical highs/lows for **investment focus**
* Foundation for future **early-warning tools**
* Evolves into a **decision support system**

## ✅ Summary

> This capstone used 20 years of data to forecast Rwanda’s agricultural trajectory, revealing growth trends and offering valuable insights for policy and investment decisions. With more granular and environmental data integration, this model could become a nationwide planning tool.

**Key Takeaway**:

> “Data is not just about the past — it’s the foundation for building Rwanda’s agricultural future.”
